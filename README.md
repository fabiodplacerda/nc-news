# Northcoders News API

Northcoders News API is a project with the intention of mimicking the building of a real-world backend service (such as Reddit), aiming to provide similar functionality and features.

## First Step

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development.

Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).

Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
